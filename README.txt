Server Seating System (Python Tkinter)
Creator: Daniel Rivas-Valencia

The system's operation works in a simple fashion with a layout as follows:

Sections --> Number of sections in the establishment
Tables --> Number of tables in the establishment
Seats --> Number of seats in the establishment

Each is inputed manually. 

The purpose of the system is to make seating in establishments easier.
All you have to do is input the party size and the program will do the rest. 
It will come up with the best available seating within your section. 
It takes available seating and seating that is already in use into account.
Tables that are no longer in use can also be reinstated into available seating.
